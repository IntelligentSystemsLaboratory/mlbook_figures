In the corresponding ROC plot, average recall isometrics have a slope of 1; the accuracy isometric here has a slope of 3, corresponding to the ratio of negatives to positives in the data set."

We can interpret this plot as a merger of the two coverage plots in coverage, employing normalisation to deal with the different class distributions. The diagonal line now indicates that C1 and C3 have the same average recall."
